## Zmi

🎃 A purely controllable react/vue/miniapp-ts application framework.

> Consider starring, thank you ❤️ and support.
>
> This project is a rewrite and modification of fork `UmiJs`

## Features

- 🔩 **Extensible** Everything is plug-in, complete life cycle

- 📦 **Out of the box** One dependency can support both `vue` / `react` / `miniapp`. `typescript` is supported by default, install `typescript`, add `tsconfig.json`

- 🙅 **A large number of no self-research** Use mature community solutions first

- 🤷‍♂️ **No routing** Not involved in runtime, `zmi` is a pure scaffolding tool

## Why?

- Then why not use UmiJs directly?

  - Zmi positioning is a purely universal **scaffolding** tool without too much integration, so if you need a high degree of integration, then UmiJs may be more suitable for you

- Why not create-react-app
  - Don't want to be highly integrated, but also configurable

## Quick start

# Create project
$ yarn create @zmi-cli/zmi-app
